                  <h3>Original Concept</h3>
                 <div class ="lists">
                    <ul><li><strong>Hans Muth :</strong></li>
                    <p>The Katana was a shocker when it first appeared, a machine that stood out everywhere it showed up. And that was exactly what Suzuki wanted when it hired Hans Muth to create a look. Newly separated from BMW, Muth immersed himself in Japanese culture and history. Especially influential were two books: Eugene Herrigel’s Zen in the Art of Archery and Reinhard Kammer’s Zen and Confucius in the Art of Swordsmanship. And it’s from this second title that the concept emerges, inspired by the classic, gently curved Japanese sword named katana.Muth characterizes the Suzuki Katana by what he calls its dramatic “flyline,” melding five key components into stylistic and aerodynamic unity: headlight, fuel tank, seat, and front and rear fenders. Central to the Katana’s unique identity is its “V-shaped gas tank,” describing the way the tank narrows toward the rider and diverges toward the front of the bike. Muth’s design was rendered in silver—like the sword.On the side cover Muth added the Japanese character for the katana sword, interleaved with a red image of the same sword. “The sword first serves as a weapon, but a katana also has a mythological meaning in Japan,” Muth said when he presented the design to Osamu Suzuki. “If you don’t treat it right, its sharpness can be lethal. The same is true for a motorcycle.Suzuki was silent for a long while, then replied, “Mutho-san, I am truly thankful to you that you haven’t named it hara-kiri.”</p>

                    <p>The Katana was not just a category of machine but a whole design ethos. And yet unlike those, the Katana was also very specific to an era: the early eighties.From 1980-1985, if you fancied a Suzuki capable of sending shivers down your spine -- you wanted a Katana, either on your bedroom wall or, preferably, garage floor.

                        No Suzuki -- no motorcycle even -- not before or since, had been so striking. The Katana still is today.While last, but by no means least, the whole family of Katanas which followed, ranging from more accessible middleweights like the <a href="https://www.globalsuzuki.com/motorcycle/smgs/digital-archive/2_bike/ss4_043.php">GS650G</a>

                     <p>What Is Old Is New Again. The original Katana 1100, introduced in 1981, combined in-line four cylinder big-bore sportbike performance with never-seen before styling that set a new benchmark in motorcycle aesthetics. Now paying tribute to that original breathtaking look, the new KATANA combines modern, state of the art performance with a retro, yet completely contemporary stance that harkens back to the original. Fans of the first model as well as younger riders who appreciate daring design will be drawn to this new KATANA. Coming as a 2020 model, the KATANA will be available in 2019 onwards. more info <a href="https://www.asphaltandrubber.com/bikes/2020-suzuki-katana/"target="_blank">here</a></p>
